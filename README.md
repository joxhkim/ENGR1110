# ENGR1110
Introduction to Software Engineering

Assigned to a group, we were tasked with creating a game using Greenfoot. Greenfoot is an integrated development environment using Java or Stride designed primarily 
for educational purposes at the high school and undergraduate level. Greenfoot allows easy development of two-dimensional graphical applications, 
such as simulations and interactive games. Through the process, we were required to document our workflow and development via Trello, and required to present
our final project. You can find more information about our process [here.](https://github.com/joxhkim/ENGR1110/files/7071199/SpaceDefenders.pdf)
